## Best practices for project organization

-   Treat data as read only
-   Data Cleaning
-   Treat generated output as disposable

# Create a new project

-   We’re going to create a new project in RStudio:
-   Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.
-   Click “New Directory”.
-   Click “New Project”.
-   Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. “my_project”.
-   If available, select the checkbox for “Create a git repository.”
-   Click the “Create Project” button.
